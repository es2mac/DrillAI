Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with PUCT is an effective algorithm for many
games.  It is most notably used in DeepMind's AlphaGo to achieve superhuman
level performance in the game of Go.

I started this project as an exercise to gain a deeper understanding of MCTS
and game AIs in general, and solving a specific problem that I'm interested in.
While currently the performance is far from state-of-the-art, I've decided to
work in public in case it could serve as a reference for anyone interested in
the topic and to foster conversations.

For the specific problem I'm tackling, please see the description of the
[predecessor to this project](https://github.com/es2mac/SwiftDigger).  The
difference between this repository and the last one is that the code has been
more rigorously engineered with additional functionalities.  Some parts, in
particular those related to machine learning, are still work in progress.

There's also a complementary iOS UI project, [DrillUI](https://github.com/es2mac/DrillUI).
